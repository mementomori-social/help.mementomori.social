# About Mementomori.social

Mementomori.social is an _experimental_ Mastodon instance hosted by Finnish web developer Roni "Rolle" Laukkarinen, who has over two decades of experience in servers and web development. The instance is financially backed and sponsored by the Finnish web agency Digitoimisto Dude Oy.

So that’s the short introduction. Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s switch to first-person mode.

### Experimental nature

What do I mean by "experimental"? Well, Mementomori.social isn't a "vanilla Mastodon" instance - I like to experiment with the latest developments. That's why the version I run is bleeding-edge, but I always make sure it runs smoothly so people can use it.

You can read more about the features on the [Instance features](../instance-features.md) page.

# About Mementomori.social

Mementomori.social is an _experimental_ Mastodon instance hosted by a Finnish web developer Roni "Rolle" Laukkarinen with two decades of server and web experience. The instance is financially backed and sponsored by a Finnish web agency Digitoimisto Dude Oy.

So that's that, the short introduction. Now that we got over it, it's time to change the narrative to first person.

### Experimental nature

What do you mean "experimental"? Well, mementomori.social is not "Vanilla Mastodon" without any modifications, if you will. I like to try out the latest things, so that's why Mastodon version I run is bleeding edge, although always working version. More about features on [Instance features](../instance-features.md) page.

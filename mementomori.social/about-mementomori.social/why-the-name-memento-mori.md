# Why the name, Memento mori?

{% hint style="warning" %}
**A content warning** is in place here as we slightly touch on _death_ as a concept related to the server name mementomori.social and the origins of the idea and the latin, stoic expression behind it.

### The origins of the server name

_Memento mori_ (Latin for _"Remember that you \[have to] die"_) is a [stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism), artistic or symbolic trope acting as a reminder of the inevitability of death. At the time on October 2022 when I (the admin, Rolle speaking) got the idea of starting my own Mastodon server, many criticized about the idea - what happens when you die? The server ceases to exist?

I found this intriguing. As a person who suffers from anxiety disorder and thanatophobia (fear of death) I have embraced the idea of remininding myself of mortality while in therapy.

I came to a conclusion that nothing is eternal and we should not think that way. You might now a website or two that no longer exist. You might know [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) or [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista)? There are numerous websites and webservices that do not exist any more. I have used loads of social media services that no longer exist. I don't know if you've heard of Jaiku, Bebo, PicPlz ("Instagram" before Instagram), Friendster, Stumbleupon, Delicious, GetGlue, Google+... Not to mention [MySpace](https://myspace.com/) and Finnish equivalent [IRC-Galleria](https://irc-galleria.net/) which both do (amazingly enough) still exist, but nobody is really streering the boat. The point is, websites come and go over the decades. Nothing is permanent. So why should a Mastodon server be?

> Why should I fear death? If I am, then death is not. If Death is, then I am not. Why should I fear that which can only exist when I do not?\
> â€”  Epicurus

While stating that we should focus on the present, **I do all I can to keep the servers up and running as long as I'm able, as long as I live and breath.**

But, we should remember.

Hence, _memento mori_. Remember.

#### About the owner, Roni "Rolle" Laukkarinen

Hello! 👋 Let me switch to first person here. I’m a web developer, entrepreneur, and sysop from Finland, a small country up north in Europe, between Russia and Sweden.

Long story short, I built my first website in 1998 when I was about ten years old. I got into computers through my father, who had his first PC back in the 80s as a hardcore hobbyist. I instantly fell in love with HTML and CSS — and the rest of the web languages followed soon after.

Open PC case beside him."><figcaption><p>Me as a teenager.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

My first Linux distribution was Mandrake (a Red Hat variant, later known as Mandriva), released in 1998. In the 2000s, I got into servers — again through my father, who ran his own home server inside a wardrobe (my mom _really_ didn’t like that, haha).

I never stopped coding or writing — I’ve been doing both daily ever since. I grew up on the Internet. My first social media experience was MySpace in the early 2000s. After that, I tried nearly every platform I came across: Jaiku, Bebo, PicPlz (basically Instagram before Instagram), Friendster, StumbleUpon, Delicious, GetGlue, Google+... and countless others — I counted more than 160 social platforms. It was the "Wild West" of social media back then, with users creating custom CSS and designs for their profiles. Then Facebook came along and changed everything — not necessarily for the better.

In 2013, I started my own company specializing in websites and servers. We build fully customized WordPress sites — lightweight, fast, and bloat-free — and host them with top-quality upkeep services. That’s how **Dude** was born. Today, we operate mainly in the Finnish market.

That’s about it. I hope you feel confident that you’re in good hands.
